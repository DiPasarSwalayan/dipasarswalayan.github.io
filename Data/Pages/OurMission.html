                    Hi, I'm Genord.
                    <br><br>
                    At Genord Motors, innovation isn't just a value - it's our foundation. When we set out to build the Model F, we weren't content with making another electric vehicle. We aimed to create something extraordinary - a car that merges cutting-edge efficiency with unmatched performance, built on the unconventional breakthroughs we've made in our research labs.
                    <br><br>
                    I know some of our methods have sparked conversation. Pushing the limits of science often does. But every advancement - from our uniquely optimized power systems to our radically efficient design - was born from a relentless drive to challenge the status quo and rethink what's possible in sustainable transport.
                    <br><br>
                    Our mission remains clear: to deliver a cleaner, bolder future of mobility that's both environmentally conscious and thrilling to drive. And we're just getting started.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you for joining us on this journey.

                    Our founders met at the back of a Wendys and decided to work together in a garage in 2018. They decided to make... motors...
                    <br><br>
                    They decided that Gregory was irrelevant and so they founded Genord Motors, as apposed to Gregorord Motors.

            <h3>The story of Genord Motors</h3><br>
            <div style="height:90%;">
                <img src="../Images/genordlogo.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: 50%; display: block; float: right; margin: 25px 5px 60px 20px; " />
                <p style="display: block; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                    Genord Motors began not in a garage or boardroom, but in an experimental biology lab - where unconventional thinking met mechanical ambition. Founded in 2018 by a small team of engineers and researchers with backgrounds in automotive design and bio-electric sciences, Genord was created with one radical goal: to build the first car powered by ideas no one else would touch.
                    <br><br>
                    In the early days, our prototypes were as much scientific experiments as they were vehicles. We explored energy sources that traditional automakers had long dismissed - drawing inspiration from biological systems, novel materials, and strange, brilliant efficiencies discovered through bold, iterative experimentation. Our first major breakthrough came in 2021, when a test system originally intended for micro-scale efficiency studies evolved into the propulsion core of what would become the Model F.
                    <br><br>
                    While our methods have occasionally drawn scrutiny, our results have been undeniable. Genord has led the way in reducing charging frequency, eliminating traditional exhaust systems, and pioneering lightweight but incredibly strong chassis materials. Today, we stand as one of the most unpredictable and forward-thinking names in clean mobility - not just building cars, but challenging the industry to think bolder, weirder, and better.
